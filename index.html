                <p>
                  WYNS is a student-led non-profit-organization that aims to support local hospitals through collective student effort. Currently, we partner with hospitals across the Lower Mainland to cater to their required needs. Our mission is to rekindle and sustain hope for families who are affected by helping hospitals have enough funds to provide the best care.
                </p>
                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>
                  Whether it is research, therapy programs, hospital expansion, or patient resources, we donate our funds to strengthen the function of our hospitals. In doing so, our hospitals can put emphasis on improved patient care.

                    Bella Chan is a second-year International Baccalaureate student at Sir Winston Churchill Secondary. She is honoured to be serving as the President of WYNS for the 2021-22 school year. Our President has been a School Head for 2 years and this is her first year on the External Executive Team. When Bella joined WYNS in 2018, she didn’t realize how much she would grow to resonate with the organization’s mission. She initially joined WYNS because she wanted to fundraise for the hospital in which she was born and make a local impact. Now, she hopes to share this mission with other Canadian youth and see more passionate youth bring WYNS’ mission to their local communities. Her favourite part about WYNS is the WYNS community: an overwhelmingly passionate, kind, and supportive group of young individuals. Bella believes that she’ll make it big as a stand-up comedian one day — though her friends aren’t exactly convinced. When she has some downtime, you’ll probably find her snacking or completing Instagram scroll-athons… or both.

                    Currently attending Burnaby Mountain Secondary School in his senior year, Chris is delighted to be serving as the Vice-President of WYNS for the 2021-22 term. Having first joined WYNS to alleviate the hardships faced by many local hospitals, Chris has become deeply passionate about the organization’s mission. He has been part of WYNS for two years, one as an Internal Executive and another as an External Executive. He hopes to make his third year with WYNS the most impactful one yet. During the precious years our Vice-President has had with WYNS, our organization has deepened his understanding of the circumstances of many hospitals and the communities WYNS has partnered with. Chris’s favourite part about WYNS is getting to work with other supportive and passionate students. In his spare time, Chris likes to play the violin and play tennis with his younger twin brother.

She shares with us, “My favourite part of WYNS is the experience. Not only have I learned so much in my position so far, but I also have the pleasure to be a part of an amazing team”. Some of her hobbies include swimming, painting, baking, and being outdoors.

Not only has she gained leadership experience, but Makayla has also formed invaluable friendships with her team of passionate individuals over the past year. Our Secretary understands the importance of giving back to her community and wishes to continue making a local impact by continuing to aid volunteers in hosting fundraisers to raise funds for local health facilities this year.

                We are constantly striving to expand, and gain more social media presence as ways to raise awareness for our cause and to reach out to those in need of hope and support. We plan on developing partnerships and buddy systems with hospitals as well as other non-profit organizations to create an effective network. With the establishments of partnerships and buddy systems with hospitals, we hope to establish active engagements between patients and their families, and volunteers.
